the Scala LIST

- Just like your favorite Hoodie;
the Scala List is that data structure you'll reach for again and again.

- A foundational DATA STRUCTURE; or container for holding several units of data, which itself can be inserted/retrieved in certain ways.
ANALOGY:  Think of FURNITURE, eg how you might access books(or pieces of data) stacked on a BOOKSHELF/KINDLE vs stacked in a deep BOX
- Scala METHODS on this structure support working with data to support DATA SCIENCE applications as IoT Services, among others.
- typically of the same uniform type; but can contain mixed types
- typically of finite length; but can be infinite
- can also support NESTED data types; eg where each data element is itself a COLLECTION of some sort

PHYSICAL ANALOGY for a COLLECTION:
     - think DISHES vs CLOTHES; both can be stored in a DRAWER, but typically you put them in separate drawers in the kitchen
     vs guest room because you have different ways of using them.
     - say type T is a GENERIC TYPE of DATA ELEMENT (think CLOTHES, or BOOKS)
     - say containers or COLLECTIONS hold those data elements (think DRESSER or DISH CABINET)

1) PHYSICAL ANALOGY FOR A LIST:
- TODO:  Go find a fun GIF!!!
- think of a TRAIN with:
  - an Engine at the front
    or HEAD
  - several Cars in the middle
    or DATA ELEMENTS
  - a Caboose at the end
    or NIL
  - all Cars after the front Engine
    or TAIL
  - you have to walk the length of the train to find a Car in the middle or the end
    or SEQUENTIAL ACCESS
  - the cars don't necessarily have to be any order
    or UNORDERED
  - you can create a new list; but adding  Cars to the END of the list
    or APPEND

2) Each data structure has a certain set of characteristics in terms of:
   TIME to access the data stored in it via OPERATIONS (methods) permitted on it
   SPACE it requires

   Depending on the problem you're trying to solve; your SECRET SAUCE as a developer or engineer,
   is your capacity to choose the optimal data structure and associated algorithm, so solve that problem;
   FASTER, with MAINTAINABLE CODE, and with FEWER RESOURCES (memory or SPACE).

   A LIST provides (CONSTANT or IMMEDIATE) access to its HEAD and TAIL
   e.g. Dedicated Engineers standing ready at those locations on the train

   It also provides (SEQUENTIAL) access to ELEMENTS within its TAIL
   e.g. Other Engineers have to WALK to TAIL Cars to find specific ones

3) ESSENTIAL Operations:
   - create
   - equals
   - exists
   - contains
   - remove
   - length
   - print
   - prepend element operator
   - concatenation or (GLUE) list operator

4) Data Science-related operations:
   - map
   - reduce
   - flatmap  (say input function creates a collection itself, so to avoid final result being NESTED collections, just use this)
   - min

5) Algo-related operations:

   - pattern-matching

REFERENCES for details on WHY SCALA:

- uniquely supports MODERN APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA very FAST

- language foundation for what could be considered the "Killer App" of the decade:   SPARK
  which supports machine learning/data science for BIG and FAST data processing so that businesses can ADAPT to
  changing conditions very FAST

- BROAD industry applications include:
  - Movie and Music recommendations
  - Election Polling voter segmentation and sentiment
  - Utility usage patterns based on smart thermostat or water faucet sensor feedback
  - Cancer genomics
  - Olympic Training
  - Neuroscience and Nuerofeedback for training the brain towards within 2 sigma 'healthy' patterns
  - triggering people to buy more stuff on Amazon

// TODO:  go over SCALABILITY
- The terms PERFORMANCE and SCALABILITY are commonly used interchangeably,
but the two are distinct: performance measures the speed with which a single request can be executed,
while scalability measures the ability of a request to maintain its performance under increasing load.
For example, the performance of a request may be reported as generating a valid response within three seconds,
but the scalability of the request measures the requestâ€™s ability to maintain that three-second response time as the user load increases.

Quoting Werner Vogels from this post "Why is scalability so hard? Because scalability cannot be an after-thought.
